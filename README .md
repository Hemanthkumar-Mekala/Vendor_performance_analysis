🧾 Vendor Performance Analysis
📘 Overview

This project represents a complete, end-to-end data analytics workflow focused on evaluating supplier efficiency and reliability. The aim is to simulate a real-world corporate data analytics scenario by analyzing vendor performance metrics to support strategic decision-making in supply chain and procurement functions.

The project covers all essential stages — from data loading, cleaning, and analysis in Python, to SQL-based performance evaluation, Power BI visualization, and presentation/report creation using Gamma AI.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains vendor transaction and delivery details such as:

Vendor ID / Name

Product category

Delivery date & expected date

Order quantity and cost

Quality ratings

Delivery status

This data enables detailed performance tracking and KPI computation (on-time delivery, cost efficiency, quality score, etc.).

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – for EDA and data cleaning

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – for performance metric queries

Power BI – for building interactive dashboards

Gamma AI / PowerPoint – for report and presentation creation

⚙️ Steps Involved
1️⃣ Data Preparation (Python)

Import and inspect the dataset

Handle missing values and outliers

Convert date/time columns

Generate KPIs (e.g., delivery delay, vendor score)

2️⃣ SQL Analysis

Load cleaned data into a relational database (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server)

Write SQL queries to calculate key metrics such as:

Average delivery delay per vendor

On-time delivery percentage

Average quality score

Cost variance

3️⃣ Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

Connect SQL database to Power BI

Design visuals to track vendor KPIs and performance rankings

Include filters for vendor category, product type, and time period

4️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

Summarize key findings in a project report

Design an AI-powered presentation using Gamma AI

Highlight insights, trends, and business recommendations

📈 Dashboard Highlights

Vendor performance scorecard

Cost vs Quality comparison

On-time delivery trend

Top and bottom performing vendors

🧮 Results & Insights

Identified top 3 vendors with the best delivery consistency and quality

Detected underperforming suppliers with frequent delays

Provided actionable recommendations for vendor selection and improvement

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Hemanthkumar-Mekala/Vendor_performance_analysis.git  
cd Vendor_performance_analysis  


Open the Jupyter notebook file (Vendor_Performance_Analysis.ipynb)

Execute the cells to perform EDA, cleaning, and SQL integration

Open the Power BI file (vendor_performance_dashboard.pbix) to explore visuals

Review the final report and presentation in /Report and /Presentation folders
